                I mainly go by lia/okk in the internet. You may know me by another name, it's probably fine to call me that too.
                My interests include computing and music mostly. I do the latter in (arch) linux, using mostly open source software.
                Feel free to ask me for help about system administration and configuration. I also enjoy low level development (with rust.)

                My music taste is comprised mainly of very energetic songs, you can check my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/okklol">last.fm</a>
                to have an idea of what I listen to. Feel free to recommend me music of any type, though, I'll gladly listen to it.
                If you want files for any tracks feel free to ask me, my library is local.

                I speak english, portuguese and spanish. Also I really like shoujo ai anime. That's the reason for the domain name.
